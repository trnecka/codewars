# CODEWARS REPOSITORY

I will share my solution from the <https://www.codewars.com>

You can run all my scripts using following command in terminal or separately

`$ python main.py`

Every script is in its own function and files. The scripts contain testing using doctest. These tests are possible using following statement:

`$ python <filename>.py`

or

`$ python -m doctest -v <filename>.py`
